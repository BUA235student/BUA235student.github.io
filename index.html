<h1>My name is..</h1>

<p>..Chris Johnson and I'm a 24 year old student in your BUA235 class. After high school I served in the United States Navy for 6 years. I want a business degree because in my opinion a business degree is one of the most universal degrees to have for any management/corporate jobs on the market. Also my brother in law is heading up an eCommerce business that is opening a second location in Maine this year and I would like to do work similar to what he does. I have linked a few things that I am interested in or have to do with my everyday life.</p>
