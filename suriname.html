<p>This page is about the country of Suriname. Suriname doesn't necessarily have anything to do with me at all other than the fact I have to write a paper on it for a different class, so I might as well also share what I learn on this web page.</p>

<p>As you can tell from the above picture, Suriname is located in northern South America between French Guiana and Guyana. The capital of Suriname is Paramaribo. The official language of Suriname is Dutch, although English is widely spoken throughout the country. Suriname's population is roughly 586,000, making it smaller, by population size, than every state in the United States of America except for Wyoming which has a population of 579,000.</p>
