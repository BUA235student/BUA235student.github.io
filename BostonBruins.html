<h1>Boston Bruins 2017-2018 Season</h1>

<img src="bruinslogo.jpeg" width="350">

<p>The Boston Bruins were one of the <i>best</i> hockey teams in the NHL last season. The forwards on the team to include <b>Patrice Bergeron</b>, <b>Brad Marchand</b>, <b>David Pastrnak</b>, as team veterans, <b>Rick Nash</b> as a key trade acquisition and <b>Jake DeBrusk</b>, <b>Danton Heinon</b>, <b>Ryan Donato</b> as young talent showed a lot of ability to dominate the offensive game. If ever an injury occurred or suspensions were dished out, the Bruins had a vast talent pool to pick from to fill those holes. The defense to include <b>Zdeno Chara</b> and <b>Charlie McAvoy</b> and goaltenders <b>Tuuka Rask</b> and <b>Anton Khudobin</b> proved they have the skillset to keep not only the puck out of the net but opposing players out of their zone. Finishing first in their division proves that even though the team could be labeled as rebuilding, because of coaching abilities to scout and play certain players in certain situations, the team was an elite contender in competing for the Stanley Cup.</p>
